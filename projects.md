# Projects

Here you can find a list of projects and collaborative efforts that I've been a part of. 

### ProteoBench

ProteoBench is an open and collaborative platform for community-curated benchmarks for proteomics data analysis pipelines. Our goal is to allow a continuous, easy, and controlled comparison of proteomics data analysis workflows. Read more in the [documentation](https://proteobench.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). You can also have a look at the [ProteoBench repository](https://github.com/Proteobench/ProteoBench), to see the code base. 

### Internal Fragment Ions 

As part of the EuBIC 2023 developers meeting, I joined a collaborative effort to analyse and visualise the internal fragment ions in proteomics data. The project is found in the [Internal Ions repository](https://github.com/veitveit/eubic23_internal_ions). 

### Peptide drug development with symbolic regression
An example of peptide drug featurization and modelling using anticancer peptides. Read this [article](https://www.abzu.ai/research/peptide-drug-development-with-symbolic-regression/), written during my time working at [Abzu](https://www.abzu.ai/). 

### Hackathons 
List of hackathons and other coding challanges. 
* [Protein Solubility Challange](https://github.com/roosavarjus/cbh21-protein-solubility-challenge)
* [Diabetes hackathon](https://github.com/roosavarjus/Diabetes-hackathon)

### Misc
