# About me 

Hi, I’m a Bioinformatics PhD specializing in proteomics, with a focus on developing computational tools and applying data science and ML to protein science. My research explores the complexities of post-translational modifications, and molecular structure, aiming to bridge experimental and computational approaches.

I have experience in international collaboration, cross-disciplinary research, and scientific communication, and I enjoy working at the intersection of biology, computation, and data science.

On this site, you’ll find an overview of my research, publications, and ongoing projects. Whether you’re a fellow researcher, potential collaborator, or just curious about molecular biology, I hope you’ll find something that sparks your interest.

Feel free to reach out!
